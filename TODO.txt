It's critical to be able to continue a subscription after a restart. Also it must be in a
subscription cache that uses an event cache.

It can be dangorous to create 2 subscriptions instead of 1 original though. Probably it's the best to start with
the newest data first. Anyways for infinite scrolling continueing is a must have.

- Another continue interface would be
  ,,continueUntil'' or something similar. A class would handle the translation from the callback to
  continueUntil higher level abstraction. countinueUntil can have a minimum element number as well that must
  be retrieved after continueUntil.
- onEose must be implemented well for batched subscriptions to be able to continue anything, though it's
  not super important if only ,,new data'' is asked for... in that case onEose is only for error handling
